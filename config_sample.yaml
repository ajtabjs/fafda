  # Expected memory usage
  # Total Memory = (partSize * concurrency * simultaneous_uploads) + 20% overhead
  #
  # Part Size:
  # - GitHub's max supported size is 2GB
  # - Must stay under 1.6GB due to driver's Â±20% randomization
  # - Recommended: Keep below 10MB unless you have few TB of ram
  # Concurrency:
  # - Depends on your internet speed, don't have time to explain math fuck around and find out
  # TL;DR for the inevitable tinkerers:
  # If you have to ask what these settings do, DON'T TOUCH THEM
  # The defaults work. Really. Just leave it alone.
